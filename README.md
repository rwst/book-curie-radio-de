## What?

This repository contains the markdown source of
etext #99999 at Project Gutenberg, as long as markdown
is not accepted as file format there. It also serves
as a tracker of issues regarding that etext, so, if
you find a transcription error, you can either fix it
yourself and commit the patch, or tell me about it in
the tracker. Thanks to github!

But you also can generate other formats from the source,
as long as you have pandoc installed, using the commands

    make txt

or

    make html

For still other formats see the pandoc documentation.
